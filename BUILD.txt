=== Building SiteMesh 3 ===

Requirements: JDK 1.6, Ant 1.6

From this directory, run:
  ant

This:
* installs Ivy (for dependency management)
* retrieves all dependencies
* compiles the libraries
* runs the tests
* generates the distribution files

For more options:
  ant -projecthelp

It also creates a 'lib' directory which contains all the dependencies. Handy if you want to build in your IDE.
